                    In general, people are very polite. It is customary to use the word 'please' at the end of most
                    sentences, especially when making requests. However, they are also quite reserved, which can make it
                    a bit challenging to make friends. As my host, Cheryl Ratcliff, often reminded me, 'Don't give up'.

                <p>
                    Obviously, the climate is cold, however, the Welsh region as a whole is slightly warmer, and even
                    warmer is the Western region, where Haverfordwest is located, which is close to the country's coast.
                    However, it still gets very cold as December approaches, meaning the closer to December, the colder
                    it gets. A disadvantage of Haverfordwest's location near the sea is that the chances of snowfall are
                    very low, and when it does snow, the snow is not thick enough for making snowballs or snowmen, but
                    it is still good to post on a social media.

                    Education here in Wales is excellent, based on my school experience. Although most of my classes
                    were IT-focused, I also had English and math classes. These subjects incorporated technology, such
                    as digital whiteboards, and online assignments. The school itself had modern facilities, like
                    electronic doors. The teachers were really demanding, pushing me to improve in every assignment.
                    They were also very understanding and patient with me, especially when I struggled with English.
                    Overall, the teachers were excellent.

                            This part can be a bit hit or miss, but I loved it. I was a little scared to try the local
                            sweet beans, but they were actually really good! The traditional Welsh food was a whole

                                Getting a warm coat here is a breeze, since it's so much colder than Brazil. Finding
                                cheap ones is easy too, especially in thrift stores if you don't mind second-hand
                                clothes. Something I noticed in Wales, from Haverfordwest to Cardiff, is that the men's
                                sections in clothing stores are tiny compared to the women's. Weird, huh?ü§î
